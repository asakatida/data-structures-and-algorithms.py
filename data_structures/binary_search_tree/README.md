# Implement a binary search tree
Create a Python class that implements the methods of a binary search tree algorithm.

## Challenge
Implement the following methods.

- `insert` inserting the value into the tree maintaining order
- `in_order` iterate through the tree calling visitor on in order
- `pre_order` iterate through the tree calling visitor on pre order
- `post_order` iterate through the tree calling visitor on post order
