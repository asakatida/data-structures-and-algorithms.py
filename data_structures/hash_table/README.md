# Implement a hash table
Create a Python class that implements the methods of a hash table algorithm.

## Challenge
Implement the following methods.

- `hash_key` converts a string into a index that fits the table buckets
- `set` inserts value into buckets under the hash for key
- `get` returns the value associated with key if in table
- `remove` deletes the entry associated with a key
