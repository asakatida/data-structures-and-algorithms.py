# Insert and shift middle index of array
Given a sorted array and a search key, find the key and return it's index or return -1 if the key is not found.

## Challenge
Algorithm input consists of a sorted array or similar language data structure, and a key value.
Output should be an index where the key can be found or -1.
No standard library solutions for array manipulation are to be used.
Search algorithm used is binary search with a time complexity of O(log n)

The stretch goal is to test algorithm use on larger datasets.
